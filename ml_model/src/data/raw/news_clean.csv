Compromise of the Democratic National Committee,6/14/2016,This incident is believed to be the work of APT 28. The Dukes were also found to be in the Democratic National Committee's networks.,"In June 2016, suspected Russian threat actors were discovered in the networks of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC). Intruders gained access to its research on Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and emails and correspondences among DNC officials. Over the course of the presidential campaign, the threat actors released DNC correspondence through intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, revealing information about infighting among top party officials and leading to the resignation of the DNC chair. The threat actors also went after John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and released more embarrassing data throughout the summer.

The secretary of homeland security and the director of national intelligence released a joint statement asserting that the protracted cyber espionage campaign was the work of Russian actors. The Barack Obama administration subsequently sanctioned Russian intelligence officials and deported suspected officers working in the United States. The DNC compromise is believed to be part of a larger Russian espionage campaign waged for the purpose of manipulating the electoral systems in Western democracies and undermining faith in the democratic process in the United States, France, Germany, and elsewhere.

In July 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted twelve officials of the Russian military intelligence agency, known as GRU, believed to have been responsible for this incident.

TV5 Monde is an example of a “false flag” operation, whereby a threat actor tries to mask its identity by leaving clues or attributes that would cause the victim to pin the blame on someone else.

Less than two weeks after the Aramco incident, the Qatari gas giant RasGas was also knocked offline by suspected state-sponsored  attackers. 

The Saudi Aramco incident signaled Iran’s growing cyber capabilities and Tehran’s willingness to use them to promote its interests, particularly in its battle of influence in the Middle East with Saudi Arabia.

Denial of service attacks against U.S. banks in 2012–2013,9/18/2012,Also known as Operation Ababil,"The websites of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and other U.S. financial institutions suffered simultaneous outages due to a coordinated denial of service cyberattack in September 2012. Attackers flooded bank servers with junk traffic, preventing users from online banking. An Iranian group called Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters initially claimed responsibility for the incident. At the time, the media reported that U.S. intelligence believed the denial of service was in response to U.S. imposed economic sanctions to counter Iran’s nuclear program. Seven Iranian individuals linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were eventually indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2016 for their involvement in the incident. 

The denial of service attacks against U.S. banks is significant for two reasons. First, the size and scale of the attacks led the State Department to seek other countries’ assistance in taking down the compromised computers that were flooding the banks with junk traffic. Second, the attacks would indicate that Iran—if it was in fact using the attacks as retaliation for U.S. financial sanctions—was acting proportionally in its dispute with the United States.",Criminal charges   https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged,"Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&T, HSBC",Iran (Islamic Republic of),Denial of service,Private sector,http://pastebin.com/mCHia4W5,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/technology/online-banking-attacks-were-work-of-iran-us-officials-say.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html

An unknown threat actor breached DigiNotar’s network in 2011 and stole authentication certificates to masquerade as other online properties.

The fallout from the cyberattack caused DigiNotar to file for bankruptcy, as it was no longer considered a reliable provider for digital security certificates.

Google was the only company that confirmed it was a victim and disclosed to the public that the Gmail accounts of certain Chinese human rights activists had been compromised. Google also publicly attributed the incident to China, something companies were reluctant to do for fear of jeopardizing their access to the Chinese market.  

The incident is viewed as a milestone in the recent history of cyber operations because it raised the profile of cyber operations as a tool for industrial espionage. It led Google to cease its operations in China, though it continues to operate a localized version of its search engine in Hong Kong.

Stuxnet,7/22/2010,Codenamed “Olympic Games” and believed to be the work of the Equation Group,"Believed to have been developed as a joint operation between U.S. and Israeli intelligence services, the Stuxnet malware compromised industrial control systems at the Natanz nuclear material enrichment facility in Iran.

Stuxnet was the first publicly known instance in which a cyber operation caused physical damage outside of a controlled testing environment. It demonstrated the potential effectiveness and value of a cyber weapon. Many experts and former government officials feared that the attack on Natanz would open the door to other states conducting destructive cyberattacks and Stuxnet would represent, in the words of former Director of the National Security Agency Michael Hayden, a moment when “somebody crossed the Rubicon.” However, nation-states have so far exercised restraint.",Denouncement   http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-stuxnet-idUSTRE73G0NB20110417,"Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, United States, Uzbekistan, Russia, United Kingdom, South Korea, Taiwan","Israel, United States",Sabotage,Military,http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/w32stuxnet-network-information,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-11388018,"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2369745,00.asp"
